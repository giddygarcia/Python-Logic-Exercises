# Python Logic Exercises: Chess Logic & OOP Calculator

Applying best practices in Python logic, object-oriented programming, and unit testing.

## I. ♟️ Chess Logic
Logic building a chess board to determine which enemy pieces a specific piece can take. Features logic for different types of chess pieces and optionally dictating all pieces.

## II. 🔢 OOP Calculator
Python Calculator built with OOP concepts and clean code standards in mind. This calculator performs standard arithmetic operations, root calculations and supports memory recall, reset, and precision setting.

### Features
* Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
* Take the nth root of a number
* Reset memory
* Adjustable decimal precision

### Contains:
1. **Calculator module**
2. **Unit Tests**
3. **Notebook file** for usage demonstration and presentation purposes
